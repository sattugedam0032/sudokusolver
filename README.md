# sudokusolver
The Sudoku Solver project implements a backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles in C++. The objective of the project is to develop a program that can efficiently solve any given Sudoku conundrum by iteratively trying possible numbers in vacant cells and backtracking whenever there are conflicts.

The program accepts an unsolved Sudoku grid as input and applies the backtracking algorithm recursively to populate the vacant cells with the correct numbers, in accordance with the Sudoku rules. It meticulously investigates various number combinations until a valid solution is found or the impossibility of solving the conundrum is determined.

This undertaking illustrates the effectiveness and force of backtracking algorithms in solving complex puzzles such as Sudoku. By using C++ as the programming language, the project ensures optimal performance and scalability, enabling the efficient resolution of Sudoku puzzles of differing degrees of difficulty.
